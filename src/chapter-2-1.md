Understanding Feedback in the Workplace

In the workplace, feedback is typically focused on job performance and behavior, geared towards helping employees improve their skills and competencies. Feedback can come from a variety of sources, including managers, peers, customers, and even self-reflection.

Feedback can be either positive or negative. Positive feedback reinforces desirable behaviors and outcomes, while negative feedback identifies areas for improvement and suggests changes. Both types of feedback are important for creating a culture of continuous improvement.
